The OpenXC functionality is exposed via a Swift library that includes some
iOS services your application can use. The library is available on GitHub in
the [openxc-ios-library][] repository

    <h2>Installation</h2>
</div>

1. Follow Apple's excellent instructions to
[download and install XCode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).
2. Clone the [openxc-ios-library][] repository using Git to get both the framework and openxc-demo app. If you don't already have Git
installed, GitHub has a [good
reference](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git) for all platforms. If you want to use openxc-framework in your existing project then follow below steps.
3. Install cocoapod if you don't already have installed <code>sudo gem install cocoapods</code>. 
4. In your existing project/New project add a pod file to it if not with the command <code>pod init</code>.For cocoapod reference [cocoapod](https://cocoapods.org/).
5. Open the pod file, add "pod openxcframework" to the pod file, and save.
6. Run the command <code>pod install</code> in terminal.
7. Open the projectName.xcworkspace in XCode. You should be able to point it at the `openxc-ios-framework` directory to open an
existing project. 

That's it! You can now proceed to the next steps to start using the framework in
your project.

Once you have the framework set up, you can start writing your first OpenXC
app using the [App Tutorial](/iOS/tutorial.html). If you are having trouble, check out the
[troubleshooting](/iOS/troubleshooting.html) steps.
